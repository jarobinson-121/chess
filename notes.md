Initial notes creation.

### Ideas for Implementation 
 - try creating a single recursive function that can be reused across all of the pieces. 
   - pass in the numbers to add or subtract from the position
   - pass in some sort of boolean as to whether it should recurse or not

### Questions
   - *Do I need to pass in the piece type? Is this handled when it is called (switch case?)*
   - *Where do we handle the initial pawn move check?*
   - *How do we handle the check for diagonal moves with pawns?*
